tcx-edit
========

Python script to edit TCX files.

It was written using the tcx files generated by TomTom's Multisport GPS Watch. So your mileage may vary.

#### Usage

    python tcx-edit.py [-h] tcx_file action arg1 [arg2 ... argN]

The resulting file will be saved as `<tcx_file>-edit.tcx` in the same path.

## Actions

#### split_at

Splits the tcx file at argument positions. It should have the format `HH:MM:SS` (from the start of the file).

Example:

    python tcx-edit.py tcx_file split_at 00:15:10 01:15:00

It will calculate general lap info for each split, like Total Time, Distance, Max Speed and Average/Max Heart Rate.

#### merge

Merges laps. Arguments should be in the `n1-n2` format, where `n1` is the beginning lap and `n2` the end lap.

Example:

    python tcx-edit.py tcx_file merge 2-3 5-8
